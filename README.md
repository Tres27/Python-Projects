# Python-Projects

I am kind of new to python. The projects I am uploading online are from various courses or tutorial I have taken online. 

Project 1- In this project I have created a python program, the main intention of the program is to make you take a break every 40 min for 3 times. Once the program is run, after every 40min "Bohemian Rhapsody" by Queen is going to be played. 


Project 2 - This is a simple python program which creates a rectangle.
